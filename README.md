# Stacey-s-Portfolio
My data analytics portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio. I'm an aspiring Data Analyst based in London, UK. 

I have always been passionate about data and during my 20 years working as a Head Office Merchandiser, in the retail industry, I have used by analytical skills to contribute towards the business strategies for the companies I have worked in.
My biggest achievement to date was creating a suite of reports for a skin care brand who had very little reporting until I joined. Using Power Query and Power Bi, I built a database, combining data sources including the company ERP and Shopify to pull together customer, channel and product data. Using this database and the reports built on the data to facilitate daily, weekly and monthly reporting. Providing up to date information for efficient and profitable decision making.
